# JavaScript Functionality for Quiz Application

This project adds interactivity to a quiz using JavaScript.

## How It Works

1. **Access Elements:** Use JavaScript (`document.querySelector`, `getElementById`) to select quiz questions, options, and control buttons.
2. **Capture Answers:** Add event listeners to options or buttons to record user selections.
3. **Track State:** Use variables to keep track of the current question, user score, and selected answers.
4. **Update the Quiz:** Dynamically update the displayed question, options, and feedback using DOM manipulation.
5. **Show Results:** After all questions are answered, display the user's score and feedback.

## Getting Started

- Link your JavaScript file to the HTML template.
- Replace the example logic with your own questions and selectors.
- Test the quiz to ensure it works as expected.
